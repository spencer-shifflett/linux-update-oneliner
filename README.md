# linux-update-oneliner
This is a simple script that allows you to go through the full update process for linux with one terminal command. Does not require you to enter your sudo password.

# How to use
1. Replace <sudo password> with the sudo password for your machine.
2. Add executable permission to the file (sudo chmod +x update).
3. Move the file to your /bin/ directory (sudo mv update /bin/update).
4. Type "update" into terminal from any directory. The command will run without the need to enter your sudo password, and your machine will be updated.
